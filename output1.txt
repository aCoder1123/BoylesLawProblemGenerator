You found a hot air balloon and need to use the gas canister to take off. Each balloon has a specific volume of gas needed for flight. Too little gas will not let you take off and too much will pop the balloon, and each gas canister has a specific amount of gas in a volume Vi, at pressure Pi. You need to pick which gas canister to use so when released into the balloon at atmospheric pressure Pf(1 atm), its volume will not exceed the maximum for the balloon but will be enough for takeoff.
